* I learned the following:
1. How data is transferred with electricity through a wire when it's on (Yes = 1), and the Bit is the smallest piece of information the computer can store. 
2. How all computers work by doing 4 steps:
* Input
* Store
* Process
* Output
3. Deep dive into some hardware inside the computer, such as the CPU which is a master chip that controls all other parts of the computer and it does so using the binary command.
