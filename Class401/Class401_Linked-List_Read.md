* I learned the following:

  1. **Data Structures** it's a concept to organize our data in different ways.
  2. There are two types of data structures:
      - **linear data structures**: They are a type of data structure that we need to go through all the items in the list in order.
      - **non-linear data structures**: They are a type of data structure that we **don't** need to go through all the items in the list.

  3. The different between arrays and linked list is the way they use memory in our machines.
  4. JS is a dynamic language that abstract dealing with memory allocation.
  5. The difference between arrays and linked list is that when we create arrays of 7 values it will take 7 bytes after each other not like linked list that will take 7 bytes but not after each other.
  6. The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures.
  7. The difference between static data structures and dynamic data structures, static data structure need to copy the data and recreate the data to allocate enough memory,  but dynamic data structure It doesn’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist.
  8. Parts of linked list:
    - **Head**: The starting point of the list is a reference to the first node.(must)
    - **Nodes**:
        - data: information what the node contains
        - next node: a reference to the next node
    - **null or empty value**
  9. Types of linked list:
       - Singly linked lists: Only go in one direction
       - doubly linked list: Go in two direction
       - circular linked list: doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value
