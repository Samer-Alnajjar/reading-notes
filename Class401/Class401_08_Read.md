* I learned the following:

1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

- basic is string-based while the bearer is token-based

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?

- that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

- This should be kept secret.

--------------------------
## Vocabulary Terms
- encryption: is the process converted into secret code that hides the informationâ€™s true meaning.
- token: Input elements other than white space and comments form the terminal symbols for the syntactic grammar for ECMAScript and are called ECMAScript.
- bearer: bearer is token-based to allow the right user authenticated.
- Secret: is what is paired with a token.
- JSON Web Token: JSON web token (JWT),, is an open standard that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON.

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

- Better understanding on Auth.
- JWT
- methods and statics

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

- JWT

## Preparation Materials

1. **RBAC** stands for Role Based Access Control and it is process by which we give permission to the user based on their access rights.

2. RBAC implementation:
   - Inventory your systems.
   - Analyze your workforce and create roles.
   - Assign people to roles.
   - Never make one-off changes.
   - Audit.
