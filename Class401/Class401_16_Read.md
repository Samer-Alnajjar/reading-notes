* I learned the following:

  1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?

FIFO queues is the same as standard queues, but it supports ordering and exactly-once processing and ensure the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved.

  2. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
 
By making the server emitting the event.

 1. What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handlingsystems, in "event driven" software.

  4. How do you test an event driven system?

Using unit testing

## Preparation Materials

- **Virtual machine**: it's like a physical machine inside your physical machine.
- **Virtualization**: is software that manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from that manipulation. You can't have cloud computing without virtualization.
- **AWS**: Cloud computing gives you access to servers, storage, databases, and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A cloud services provider such as Amazon Web Services, owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed
