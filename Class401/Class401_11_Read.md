## Preparation Materials

- Event Driven Programming: Simply put, event-driven programming is when a program is designed to respond to user engagement in various forms.

- Node Event: Node. js has a built-in module, called "Events", where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events. The EventEmitter Object. You can assign event handlers to your own events with the EventEmitter object.
