**This is what I learned in class 201_10:**

* I learned the following:

    1.  To debug better we need to understand how the code is excuted.
    2. There are two excution context:

        - Global context(Not in a function)
        - Function context(Inside a function)

    3. JS interpreter process one line of code at a time, if it needs a nother data it will wait untill the data is here then move on.

    4. Hoisting is like whereever you decalre a function then call it above the decleration it will work.

    5. Scope variable in general it's wehen using a variable inside a function you can't use it outside the function but the other is correct.

    6. Part of error handelling is learning how to read error object, and the error object conssist of:

        - Name
        - Description
        - File number
        - Line Number
