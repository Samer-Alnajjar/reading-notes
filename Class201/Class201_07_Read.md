**This is what I learned in class 201_07:**

* I learned the following:

    1. How to create HTML tables, and it goes as the following:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th scope="col">Saturday</th>
        <th scope="col">Sunday</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>15</td>
        <td>30</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>45</td>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>45</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>60</td>
        <td>90</td>
        <td>90</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <table>


- The table element is used
to create a table. The contents
of the table are written out row
by row.

- You indicate the start of each
row using the opening **tr** tag tag.
(The tr stands for table row.)
It is followed by one or more
**tr**  elements (one for each cell
in that row).
At the end of the row you use a
closing **tr** tag.
- Each cell of a table is
represented using a **td**
element. (The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing **td** tag.
- The **th** element is used just
like the **td** element but its
purpose is to represent the
heading for either a column or
a row. (The th stands for table
heading.)

2. I learened how to declare a function and it goes as the following:

function nameOfThe Function () {
  what inside the function
};

3. To invoke the function we just type in the name of the function followed by prantheses.as the following:

nameOfTheFunction();
