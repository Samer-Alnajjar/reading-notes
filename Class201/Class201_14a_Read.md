   # CSS3

  ### Transform
   1. We can use css transform property to to size, position, and change elements.
   2. There are many transform properties such as:

      - **Rotate**, ex: transform: rotate(20deg);
      - **scale**, ex: transform: scale(.75);
      - **translate**, ex: transform: translate(-10px, 25%);
      - **skew**, ex: transform: skew(5deg, -20deg);
      - and many more, please check this link for more properties:

  ### Transitions & Animations
    1. In CSS3 we have the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations.
    ex:
    
      .box {
      background: #2db34a;
      transition-property: background;
      transition-duration: 1s;
      transition-timing-function: linear;
      }

    2. Also we can use some properties to add some animation to the elements such as **slide**.
