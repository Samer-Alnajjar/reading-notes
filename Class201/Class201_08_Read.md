**This is what I learned in class 201_08:**

* I learned the following:

1. I learned that there are two types of elements in HTML, inline elements such as : the img tag, the b tag, etc ... and block elements such as h1 tag, the ptag, etc...

2. There are three types of poistioning schemas:
    - Normal flow
    - Relative flow
    - Absolute flow

3. An example of the positions: 

    - Normal Flow:
        - In normal flow each block element sits on top of the next element.

    - Relative Flow:
        - Relative positioning moves an
        element in relation to where it
        would have been in normal flow.
        
        Ex: position: relative;

    - Absolute Flow:
        - When an absolute posion is used, The element is taken out of normal flow and doesn't affects the position of other elements.
        
        Ex: position: absolute;

    - Fixed position:
        - It's a type of absolute positiong that it's values to be fixed.
        
        Ex: position: fixed;

4. Also I learned about the float property which is you to take an element in normal
flow and place it as far to the
left or right of the containing
element as possible.

5. I learned that your site will be visted from diffrent users with diffrent devices some from laptop some from mobile devies.

So each device has a diffrent resolution.        

6. web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide.

7. I learned a little about grid which you can use it to divide the page as grids which you can control the size for them.
