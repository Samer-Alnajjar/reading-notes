**This is what I learned in class 201_03:**


* I learned the following:

1. There are three types of lists:
    * The ordered list (**<ol>**).
    * The unordered list (**<ul>**).
    * The definition list (**<dl>**).

2. Every content in HTML is surrounded by a box, and the default dimension for that box is enough to hold it's content, and we can control the dimension of that box using the following properties:
    * Width.
    * Height.
    * Min-width.
    * Max-width.
    * Min-height.
    * Max-height.
    * Overflow: hidden/scroll.

    **Note: For the above properties (except overflow) we can use percentages, pixels, or ems as unit**

3. I learned about the switch statement and how to use it, and it's the best option for multiple choices decisions.
