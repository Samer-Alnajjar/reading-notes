  * Growth mindset, which is in short words, it's like everything will become easy with time, you just have to keep moving forward.
  and always remmeber the following to keep you moving forward:
    1-No one is born with these skills, so everyone went through what you are in now.
    2-Remmber that your instructor Tamim also went through this and he is now a software development instructor.
    3-It will become easier daya after day, just keep moving forward.
