**This is what I learned in class 201_08:**

* I learned the following:

1. I learned that there are two types of elements in HTML, inline elements such as : the img tag, the b tag, etc ... and block elements such as h1 tag, the ptag, etc...

2. There are three types of poistioning schemas:
    - Normal flow
    - Relative flow
    - Absolute flow

3. An example of the three types 

    - Normal flow:

        h1 {
background-color: #efefef;
padding: 10px;}
p {
width: 450px;}

    - Relative flow:

        p.example {
position: relative;
top: 10px;
left: 100px;}

    - Absolute flow:

      h1 {
position: absolute;
top: 0px;
left: 500px;
width: 250px;}
p {
width: 450px;}
