**This is what I leanred in class 102_07:**

* I learned the following:

1. JavaScript is a script programming language that used to make the website interactive.
2. Variables are like a container to store data (numbers, strings, or booleans)in them.
3. Expressions results in a single value, and there are two types of expressions:
    * expressions that assign a value to a variable. ex: var color = 'beige';
    * expressions that use two or more values to return a single value. ex: var area = 3 * 2;
4. Operators allow programmers to create a single value, we have five types of operators:
    * ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS, ex: color = 'beige';
    * COMPARISON OPERATORS, ex: buy = 3 > 5;
    * ARITHMETIC OPERATORS, ex: area = 3 * 2;
    * STRING OPERATORS, ex: buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);
    * LOGICAL OPERATORS, ex: greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';
5. Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.and there are two stages , declare the function, then call the function.
