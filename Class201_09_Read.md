**This is what I learned in class 201_09:**

* I learned the following:

    1. Forms are used to take input user, wether it's an email, password, or the search bar in google website.

    2. There are many types of form:

        - Text
        - Radio button
        - Checkbox
        - Submit button

    3. Also the forms works, first the user need to enter the data, after that he submit his data by clicking on submit button, then the server processes the information and create a new web page as a response.

    4. Form construct of the following attribute:

        - action attribure: is where do you want to send the request.

        - method attribute is type of request
        
      
    5. I learned there are two main types of lists:

        - Unordered list (ul)

        - Ordered list (ol)

    6. Also we can change the list style position using a property (list-style-position)

    7. Table in HTML conssist of:

        - tabel row (tr)
        - table head (th)
        - table data (td)

    8. Events in JS can be triggered by more than one way, for example we can trigger an event by clicking on a button.

    9. The event passes through three stages:

        - Select an element the user will interact with it.

        - Specify the event, like clicking on a button.

        - Call the fuction.
