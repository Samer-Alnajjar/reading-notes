**This is what I learned in class 301_06:**

* I learned the following:

1. **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine.
2. **The V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. it's responsible for compiling JS code.
3. It's better to install NVM(Node Version Manager), in case you have to install different versions of node JS.
4. To install nvm please follow it's original repo [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
5. To check the node versions you have, type **nvm ls**
6. To install a certain version of nvm, type **nvm install -version-** 
7. To use a node version other than the one you are using, type **nvm use -version-**.
8. Please refer to this page for deploying nvm [nvm guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/)
9. We use npm to install node packages.
10. When installing node packages it will create a file **package.json**, and it will contain all the packages we installed.
