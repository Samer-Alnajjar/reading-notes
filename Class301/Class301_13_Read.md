![Client/Server architecture](https://madooei.github.io/cs421_sp20_homepage/assets/client-server-1.png)


* I learned the following:

1. **Client/Server architecture**, a client sends a request to a server using a http, then the server receives the request and process the data then respond with a respond.
2. From the client side, we can send data (store data) using either postman, or the most common way and the only way , is using a form in the browser.
3. **The action attribute**, The action attribute is where the data is sent.
4. **The method attribute**, we can use either GET ot POST, GET used to retrieve data, POST used to store data.
