**This is what I learned in class 203_01:**

* I learned the following:

1. I learned the difference between Responsive vs. Adaptive vs. Mobile, **Responsive**, generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while **adaptive**, means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, **Mobile**, means to build a separate website commonly on a new domain solely for mobile users
2. Responsive web design has threem main components:
   - **flexible layouts**, Using relative units instead of fixed units.
   - **media queries**,  provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances
   - **flexible media**
3. **float**, is a CSS positioning property, We can use to wrap text around images.
4. Grid, which is layout system that we use to position elements in our page, it uses as attribute value such as "col-2-3".
5. From the SMACSS doc, there are **base rules**, (single element selector), **layout rules**, divide the page into sections, **modules**, modular parts of our design. They are
the callouts, the sidebar sections, **State rules** ways to describe how our modules or layouts will
look when in a particular state.
