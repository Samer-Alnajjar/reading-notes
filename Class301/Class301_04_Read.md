**This is what I learned in class 301_04:**

* I learned the following:

1. Grid css, is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system.
2. We need to add "display:grid" to use grid.
3. We can define columns and rows for grid, such as:
  "grid-template-columns:" ;
  "grid-template-rows: ;"

4. A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp, also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern.
