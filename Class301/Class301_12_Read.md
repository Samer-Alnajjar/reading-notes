* I learned the following:

1. **EJS partial**, it's like a function, where you can reuse the same markup script more than one.
2. You can use mosteluy at parts in the page that doesn't change, such as the **navbar** and the **footer**.
3. To create partials we create a folder called **partails** in the views folder, and inside it we create file.ejs which will contain the parts that will not change such as navbar and footer.
4. to inject partials files we will use **<%-name of the file%>**.
