**This is what I learned in class 301_07:**

* I learned the following:

1. Representational state transfer (REST),  The whole world wide web is built on this architectural style.
2. Redirect, is when a website is requesting from the another website.
3. A different methods used in http protocol, is get, post, and delete.
4. Each URL is called a request while the data sent back to you is called a response.
5. The Anatomy Of A Request:
   - The endpoint
   - The method
   - The headers
   - The data (or body)

6. We can send some data with the request such as query string, which is indicated after "?" and we can add combine query strings with adding "&".
7. Here are some HTTP Status Codes And Error Messages:
   - 200+ means the request has succeeded.
   - 300+ means the request is redirected to another URL.
   - 400+ means an error that originates from the client has occurred.
   - 500+ means an error that originates from the server has occurred.
