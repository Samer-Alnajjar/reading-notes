**This is what I learned in class 301_07:**

* I learned the following:

1. **Functional programming** is a style of programming â€” that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. The first fundamental concept is pure functions. Which means it should return the same results as the input, it doesn't do anything else except one objective.
3. If the function is reading a file so it's not a pure function,  also the function that generate random numbers.
4. The benefits of pure function is easy to test.
5. Immutable data means it can't change it's state when created, the workaround is copy the data to another data.
6. A **hash function** is used to map a given key to a location in the hash table
